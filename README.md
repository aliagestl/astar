# astar
C++ A* search algorithm
Tested program using Catch:https://github.com/philsquared/Catch/blob/master/docs/tutorial.md

What does it do?
In Search.cpp constructor, a 2D array makes a map. Then Search.astar() utilizes A* algorithm to search the map for the ideal path.

Future plans?
I would like to implement this into a future game for an enemy AI of some sort.
